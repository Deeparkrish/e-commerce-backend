   ## Process
  The user is provided with a functional Express.js API
  * At start a .env file is created where ,the user adds the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment    variable file(dtoenv)
  * He is able to connect to a database using Sequelize
  * Then he enters schema(mysql) and seed commands(npm run seed) upon which,
    a development database is created(ecommerce_db) and is seeded with test data
  * When the app is invoked, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the database.
  * When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia/Postman for categories, products, or tags, 
    the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON object.
  * The user can test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia and he shall be able to successfully create,read,update, 
    and delete data in the database.
    
  ## Technologies
   The MySQL2  and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use              environment variables to store sensitive data, like MySQL username, password, and database name.
